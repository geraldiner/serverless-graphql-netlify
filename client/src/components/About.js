					Curiosity-driven Sotware Engineer who loves delivering exceptional and delightful digital experiences

					I love answering questions almost as much as I love asking them. I thrive in places where research, innovation, and creativity are all
					common practices.
				</p>
				<p className="my-4">
					Despite being an introvert, I love people and hearing their stories. In a way, I get to experience life vicariously through them and
					empathize with what they’re going through. Because of this, I want to see them happier and live more fulfilling lives.
				</p>
				<p className="my-4">
					My passion for education brought me to various experiences in outreach, mentoring, and leadership. Coming from an underprivileged
					background, I take any opportunity to bring as many people as I can up with me. I believe there is room for everyone at the top.
				</p>
				<p className="my-4">
					My knowledge and experience in design and development are just the tools I use to do what I do best: bring joy to people’s lives.
